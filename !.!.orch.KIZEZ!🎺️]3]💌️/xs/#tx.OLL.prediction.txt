>>> how does a decoder only transformer know what words from
...  the corpus/ vocab to pick for output in response to que
... ry ? at what step does that happen? 
In a Decoder-Only Transformer, the decoding process is responsible 
for generating the output sequence given the input sequence and the 
encoded context. Here's a high-level overview of how it works:

1. **Encoder**: The encoder takes the input sequence (e.g., "What is 
your name") and generates a continuous representation of the input 
sequence, often referred to as the "context" or "encoder output". 
This process is typically done using self-attention mechanisms.
2. **Decoder Init**: The decoder initializes its internal state by 
concatenating the encoder output with a special token (e.g., `[CLS]`)
that represents the beginning of the output sequence. This token is 
added to facilitate generation of the first word in the output 
sequence.
3. **Decoder Loop**:
	* For each time step `t`, the decoder takes its previous state as i
input and generates a prediction for the next output word.
	* The prediction is based on the previous output words, the encoder 
output, and self-attention over the entire context.
	* The decoder uses this prediction to generate the next output word.
4. **Vocabulary Selection**: At each time step `t`, the decoder needs
to select a word from the vocabulary to append to the output 
sequence. This is where the magic happens!

To make this selection, the decoder typically uses a combination of:

	* The previous output words (context)
	+ The encoder output
	+ Self-attention over the entire context

The decoder calculates a score for each possible output word in the 
vocabulary, considering the above factors. The word with the highest 
score is then selected as the next output word.

In more detail, this process might involve:

1. Calculating attention weights over the input sequence (encoder 
output) and previous output words.
2. Using these attention weights to calculate a weighted sum of the 
input sequence and previous output words.
3. Adding this sum to the decoder's internal state (previous hidden 
state).
4. Applying a linear transformation (e.g., feed-forward neural 
network) to the combined representation.
5. Passing the result through a softmax function to generate a 
probability distribution over the vocabulary.
Q. so the result of the linear transform and the "vocab" need to both 
go through the softmax in order to get a probability distrobution ? 
how would that look like in pure C ? 
linear[linear_rows][linear_cols]
vocab[vocab_rows][2]

6. Sampling from this distribution to select the next output word.

This process is repeated for each time step, generating the final 
output sequence.

In summary, the decoder uses its internal state, the encoder output, 
and self-attention mechanisms to calculate scores for each possible 
output word in the vocabulary. The word with the highest score is 
then selected as the next output word.

In the context of neural networks, a softmax function is used to 
generate a probability distribution over the output space (in this 
case, the vocabulary). The result of the linear transformation and 
the vocabulary both need to go through the softmax function to get a 
probability distribution.

Here's how you might implement this in pure C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <math.h>

// Define some constants for the size of arrays
#define LINEAR_ROWS 128
#define LINEAR_COLS 256
#define VOCAB_ROWS 5000
#define VOCAB_COLS 2

// Function to calculate the softmax function
void softmax(double *output, double *input) {
    int i;
    double max_val = -INFINITY;

    // Find the maximum value in the input array
    for (i = 0; i < LINEAR_ROWS; i++) {
        if (input[i] > max_val) {
            max_val = input[i];
        }
    }

    // Calculate the softmax function
    for (i = 0; i < LINEAR_ROWS; i++) {
        output[i] = exp(input[i] - max_val);
    }

    // Normalize the values so they add up to 1.0
    double sum = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < LINEAR_ROWS; i++) {
        sum += output[i];
    }
    for (i = 0; i < LINEAR_ROWS; i++) {
        output[i] /= sum;
    }
}

int main() {
    // Initialize arrays
    double linear[LINEAR_ROWS][LINEAR_COLS];
    double vocab[VOCAB_ROWS][VOCAB_COLS];

    // Fill in the values for linear and vocab here...

    // Calculate softmax function for linear array
    double output[LINEAR_ROWS];
    softmax(output, linear);

    // Do something with the result of the softmax function...
    return 0;
}
```

This is a simple implementation that doesn't account for issues like 
overflow when calculating `exp(input[i] - max_val)`. You should 
consider using a more robust library or implementing more careful 
arithmetic to handle these edge cases.

>>> how does that use the vocab to calculate probability of word ? 
I apologize for the confusion earlier. The `softmax` function I 
provided doesn't actually use the vocabulary array to calculate the 
probability distribution.

In a real-world implementation, you would typically pass both the 
linear output and the vocabulary array as input to the softmax 
function. Here's an updated example that demonstrates how this might 
work:
```c
void softmax(double *output, double *linear, double **vocab) {
    int i, j;
    double max_val = -INFINITY;

    // Find the maximum value in the linear output
    for (i = 0; i < LINEAR_ROWS; i++) {
        if (linear[i] > max_val) {
            max_val = linear[i];
        }
    }

    // Calculate the softmax function using vocabulary
    for (i = 0; i < VOCAB_ROWS; i++) {
        output[i] = exp(linear[0] + vocab[i][0]); // Assume vocab has
two columns, where first column is score offset
    }

    // Normalize the values so they add up to 1.0
    double sum = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < VOCAB_ROWS; i++) {
        sum += output[i];
    }
    for (i = 0; i < VOCAB_ROWS; i++) {
        output[i] /= sum;
    }
}
```
In this updated implementation, the `softmax` function takes three 
inputs:

1. `output`: The array where the softmax result will be stored.
2. `linear`: The linear output array that was generated earlier.
3. `vocab`: A 2D array representing the vocabulary, where each row 
corresponds to a word and the first column contains score offsets.

The `softmax` function calculates the softmax probability 
distribution for each word in the vocabulary using the linear output 
and score offsets from the vocabulary. The resulting probabilities 
are stored in the `output` array.

Note that this implementation assumes a simple scoring mechanism 
where the score offset is added to the linear output to generate the 
final score for each word. You may need to adjust this logic 
depending on your specific use case.

>> let me clarify . this is what my vocab array looks like pre storing into a 7x2 matrix = "
... 1 <*>
... 2 i
... 3 drink
... 4 and
... 5 know
... 6 things
... 7 <!>" , can you modify the code even better given that information?
I understand now. Thank you for clarifying! Given your vocabulary array is a jagged 
array of strings (char*), where each string represents a word in the vocabulary, I'll 
modify the `softmax` function to accommodate this.

Here's the revised implementation:
```c
void softmax(double *output, double *linear, char ***vocab) {
    int i, j;
    double max_val = -INFINITY;

    // Find the maximum value in the linear output
    for (i = 0; i < LINEAR_ROWS; i++) {
        if (linear[i] > max_val) {
            max_val = linear[i];
        }
    }

    // Calculate the softmax function using vocabulary
    for (i = 0; i < VOCAB_ROWS; i++) {
        int j;
        double score = 0.0;
        char *word = vocab[i][0];  // Get the word string from the vocab array
        for (j = 0; j < strlen(word); j++) {  // Calculate score based on the word's 
ASCII value
            score += word[j];
        }
        output[i] = exp(score - max_val);
    }

    // Normalize the values so they add up to 1.0
    double sum = 0.0;
    for (i = 0; i < VOCAB_ROWS; i++) {
        sum += output[i];
    }
    for (i = 0; i < VOCAB_ROWS; i++) {
        output[i] /= sum;
    }
}
```
In this revised implementation, I've made the following changes:
1. **Vocabulary array handling**: I'm now assuming that each element of your vocabulary
jagged array is a string (char*) representing a word.
2. **Score calculation**: I'm calculating the score for each word by summing up the 
ASCII values of its characters. This might not be the most sophisticated approach, but 
it should give you a basic idea of how to incorporate your vocabulary array into the 
softmax function.

Please note that this implementation assumes you have separate variables `VOCAB_ROWS` 
and `LINEAR_ROWS` representing the number of rows in your vocabulary and linear output 
arrays, respectively. You'll need to adjust these values according to your specific use
case.

>>> on the famous diagram, why are the outputs for decoder only transformer
...  "shifted right"? 
... 
The diagram you're referring to is likely the Transformer model's 
attention mechanism, also known as the "multi-head attention" 
mechanism. In this diagram, the output of the self-attention 
mechanism (decoder-only) is indeed shifted right by one position.

To understand why, let's break down what's happening in the decoder:

1. **Self-Attention Mechanism**: The decoder takes the previous 
token's representation (`h_prev`) and uses it to compute attention 
weights for each token in the input sequence.
2. **Shifted Right**: The output of this self-attention mechanism is 
then shifted right by one position, effectively "delaying" the effect
of the current token on the output.

Why do we shift the output right? Well, consider what happens when 
you're generating a sequence (e.g., translating a sentence). You want
to predict the next token based on the context established by the 
previous tokens. By shifting the output right, you effectively 
"propagate" the effect of the current token back in time, allowing 
the model to take into account the context established by all 
previous tokens.

Think of it like this: when predicting the next token, you want to 
consider not only the current token but also the tokens that came 
before. Shifting the output right allows the model to incorporate 
this context, making the predictions more informed and accurate.

In summary, shifting the output right in a decoder-only Transformer 
is a way to propagate the effect of the current token back in time, 
enabling the model to consider the entire sequence context when 
generating the next token.

Does that make sense?

>>> no it makes no sense whatsoever 
That's okay! It can be tricky to understand some concepts in deep 
learning. Let me try to explain it again, and maybe we can break it 
down together:

1. **Self-Attention Mechanism**: The self-attention mechanism is a 
way for the model to "attend" to different parts of the input 
sequence when generating each token. It's like looking at different 
pieces of information and deciding how important they are.

2. **Shifted Right**: When we shift the output right, it means that 
we're taking the attention weights and moving them one position 
forward in time. This has the effect of "delaying" the influence of 
the current token on the output.

3. **Why Shift?**: We shift the output right because when we're 
generating a sequence, we want to consider the context established by
all previous tokens. By delaying the influence of the current token, 
we can incorporate that context into our predictions.

Here's an analogy: think of the self-attention mechanism like looking
at different pieces of a puzzle. When you shift the output right, 
it's like taking those pieces and moving them one position forward in
time. You're effectively considering not just the current piece, but 
all the previous ones as well when making your prediction.

Does that help clarify things?
