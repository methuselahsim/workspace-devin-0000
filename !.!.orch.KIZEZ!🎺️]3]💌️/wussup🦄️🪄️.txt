🦾️even if this "DOESN"T WORK" 1rst try , 
id like to teach "RL/llm? 2 make "HALO CHIPS" based on 
teaching it to recognize "chip names/descriptions and diagrams"
(and even auto corpus banking/scoring "good prompts")<- struct 4 this?
🧠️and think about different archs and strategies like this
and kinda rev ngn, from small RL/Q (mex etc) 2 try 2 find
"OPTIMAL SOLU🧠️
certainly wouldn't hurt 2 learn "liter functiona ml-archs"
this was a good "primer"esp4 a smoler fast proj...➰️

im really interested in a model that is good at doign "2 different things"
*by being good at random ness or something
🤯️(OR BY META CHOOSING META-WEIGHTS BASED ON META SCORES<<<<
🤖️//
(making halo chips could be a good place 4 that... (and be going towards SWE)\\BUT i would also like it 2 3d"GAME" and even game fork strategies
based on "w/e"

((build out strucs for both, see if/how they "meet"? ))
(can game be coded in halo/vectors somehow?/asap? )
💡️*can mex/weights (be built 2) handle holding BINARY OR FLOAT (by normalizing or something?_those sort of strategies give flexibility 💡️)
going towards self orchestration based on weights etc ;) 

+ going towards stock market data. learning 2 make its own market? 
getting mex like that going on paper(1d)? etc

QUANTUM IN HALO, . 

ALSO SELF BUILDLING HALO GIVE IT TRUTH TABLES. 
HAVE IT MAKE CHIPS 4 A CERTAIN OUTCOME. AND COMPILE AND TEST AND REWARD
ITSELF. ETC. 

IF IT KEEPS EXPERIMENTING IT SHOULD BEABLE 2 MAKE ANYTHING WITH "nand"
AND REUSE W/E WEIGHTS WERE HELPFUL IT NEEDS 2 MANAGE ITS OWN "uSEFUL WEIGHTS"
THE SAME WAY AS CHIPS... OR SOMETHING.EVEN LABLE THEM (4 HUMAN) USING 
LOG NOTES, LIKE A FS THINGI)

📅️jul 29 . fixed alot of stuff (including embeddings,...
im wondering if "PE" are right (cuz tehy just return identical random #'s)
(No i checked, pe is "UPSIDE DOWN" but its good 2 go. <3
it looks NICE m8 good job <3 ) (its matrx size dep and thats good. 

id just look at🏆️ 19 vs 20 now...
