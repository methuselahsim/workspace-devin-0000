 how does a decoder only transformer know what words from the corpus/ vocab to pick for output in response to query ? at what step does that happen?

🤩️vocab != corpus tbh , everything in your corpus is PROBABLY in a "DICTIONARY.txt" (out of vocab words)? theres a way 2 handle but this is all "PRE TX" u may wann do this after; itll be ok, its more of a mod tbh <3🤩️ 

^.(llama2.c never reuses code "ie Matmult in header etc")
---u know that makes it ezier 2 debug etc, right? 🦄️

⁉️(because it was only 1 word (in answer) there wasn't much 
 to compare 2 . do we put the old WITH the NEW instead?
 👩🏻‍🔬️we can try that, and maybe should, 👩🏻‍🔬️
 but the old code is so jacked and gerry rigged, 
 that its probably faster 2 move on 2 n ew🏎️

🏁️it could even happen that i make this BINARY one day
(ez compared 2 this tbh), etc w/e
⭐️i bet therese EVEN  "MACRO CORPUS CLASSIFICATION" we can do etc, so we know if we need 2 go into certaain/every corpus
2 get the answer etc . so , yea...(u score "each corpus" , as if it was a word/char 2 know if u shoul deven go into it
AND THATS `what im callin` "MICRO-ML"(opposite of META/MACRO-ML), u may wanna extract this inisght, cuz were
probably gonna do that 🤯️ A L O T 🤯️ 
(and use rl weights , instead of digging thru text each time ;) 
, and as we learn ml we'll have other arch insights <3💝️ ⭐️
🏁️
📮️
(its good 2 do these by diagram cuz u learn SPECIFICS)+
we can use this one "FOREVER" & with "OTHER ARCHS ;)"
it should be so EZ it could be used 2 "TEACH" ie : KISS
(u should beable 2 use old code as a "code bank" 2 inform new
📮️
🎺️

👩🏻‍🦯️
last "tx arch" ew made, we made IN THE DARK cuz we HAD to

i literally beleive we can get done 🏎️ FASTER ,🏎️ 🏎️ 🏎️ 🏎️ 🏎️ 🏎️
if we basically start over, using our learnings
i aint coding this after all, OLL is.. 
and if ew just follow the "DIAGRAM OF TX this time then:

 Transformer LLMArchitecture!

I'll provide a high-level overview of your architecture, highlighting the key 
components and potential issues.

**Encoder**
You have two encoders (`encoder_0` and `decoder_1`) with similar architectures. Each 
consists of:

1. **Indexer**: Indexes the input corpus.
2. **Embeddings**: Embeds the query into a vector space.
3. **PE (Positional Encoding)**: Adds positional encoding to the embedded query.
4. **Concat (+)**: Concatenates the embedded query and its position encoding.
5. **MHA (Multi-Head Attention)**: Performs self-attention over the concatenated input.
6. **Add&Norm**: Applies additive attention and layer normalization.

**Decoder**
The decoder (`decoder_0` and `decoder_1`) has a similar architecture to the encoder, 
with some differences:

1. **Embeddings**: Embeds the query into a vector space (same as the encoder).
2. **PE (Positional Encoding)**: Adds positional encoding to the embedded query.
3. **Concat (+)**: Concatenates the embedded query and its position encoding.
4. **MHA (Multi-Head Attention)**: Performs self-attention over the concatenated input,
with masked attention for decoder inputs.

**FeedForward**
You have two FeedForward components (`FeedForward_0` and `FeedForward_1`) that process 
the output of the Add&Norm layers.

**Linear and Softmax**
The final layer applies a linear transformation followed by a softmax activation 
function to generate the probability distribution over the answer space.

**Potential Issues**

1. **Double-layered MHA**: In the decoder, you're performing masked attention twice 
(lines 4 and 5). This might not be necessary; consider removing one of the layers.
2. **Unnecessary FeedForward**: You have two FeedForward components (`FeedForward_0` 
and `FeedForward_1`). Are both necessary? Could one be combined or removed?
3. **Lack of padding handling**: When processing answers, you're concatenating the 
input and answer embeddings (lines 4-5). This might lead to issues with padding. 
Consider using a separate padding layer or handling padding explicitly in your 
implementation.
4. **Unspecified 'end token'**: You mention an 'end token' (`<!>`) as the termination 
signal for the decoder. How are you handling this token? Is it properly handled 
throughout the architecture?

Overall, your architecture looks like a typical Transformer-based LLMArchitecture, with
some minor variations and potential issues to consider.
