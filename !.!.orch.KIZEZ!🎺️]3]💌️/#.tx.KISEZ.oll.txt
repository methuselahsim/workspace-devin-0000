>>> does positional encoding use word embeddings

In the original "Attention Is All You 
Need" paper by Vaswani et al. (2017), 
positional encoding (PE) is used to inject
spatial information into the model. 
However, PE is **not** calculated using 
word embeddings.

Instead, PE is a fixed, learned 
representation that captures the relative 
positions of tokens in a sequence. It's a 
simple trick to make the model aware of 
the token order without relying on 
recurrent or convolutional architectures.

In more detail, PE is added element-wise 
to the input representations (e.g., token 
embeddings) before processing them with 
self-attention mechanisms. The PE values 
are learned during training and remain 
fixed at test time.

To calculate PE, you can use a sine-cosine
function, as introduced in the paper:

What a challenge!

The paper "Attention Is All You Need" by Vaswani et al.
(2017) introduces a novel attention-based architecture 
for neural machine translation (NMT). I'll summarize 
the key points and translate the math equations into 
pure C code, using the Keras-like notation.

**Summary**

The paper proposes the Transformer model, which 
replaces traditional recurrent or convolutional 
architectures with self-attention mechanisms. The 
Transformer consists of an encoder and a decoder. The 
encoder transforms input sequences (e.g., sentences) 
into continuous representations. The decoder generates 
output sequences (e.g., translations) by attending to 
the encoded input.

**Math Formulas**

1. **Multi-head attention**: Compute attention weights 
between query `Q`, key `K`, and value `V` matrices:
```c
// In C: (Note: This is not optimized for performance)
float attentions[K][Q][V];
for (int i = 0; i < K; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < Q; j++) {
        for (int k = 0; k < V; k++) {
            attentions[i][j][k] = softmax(Q * K * V, K 
* V);
        }
    }
}
```
Here, `softmax` is the standard softmax function, and 
`Q`, `K`, and `V` are the query, key, and value 
matrices, respectively.

2. **Self-attention**: Compute attention weights 
between input sequences:
```c
// In C: (Note: This is not optimized for performance)
float self_attentions[seq_len][seq_len];
for (int i = 0; i < seq_len; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < seq_len; j++) {
        self_attentions[i][j] = 
softmax(input_seq[i].dot(input_seq[j]), seq_len);
    }
}
```
Here, `seq_len` is the sequence length, and `input_seq`
is the input sequence.

3. **Encoder**: Compute encoder outputs using 
multi-head attention:
```c
// In C: (Note: This is not optimized for performance)
float encoder_outputs[seq_len][d_model];
for (int i = 0; i < seq_len; i++) {
    float att_weights[seq_len];
    for (int j = 0; j < seq_len; j++) {
        att_weights[j] = self_attentions[i][j];
    }
    encoder_outputs[i] = weighted_sum(att_weights, 
input_seq[i]);
}
```
Here, `d_model` is the model dimensionality, and 
`weighted_sum` computes the weighted sum of the input 
sequence using the attention weights.

4. **Decoder**: Compute decoder outputs using 
multi-head attention:
```c
// In C: (Note: This is not optimized for performance)
float decoder_outputs[seq_len][d_model];
for (int i = 0; i < seq_len; i++) {
    float att_weights[seq_len];
    for (int j = 0; j < seq_len; j++) {
        att_weights[j] = self_attentions[i][j];
    }
    decoder_outputs[i] = weighted_sum(att_weights, 
encoder_outputs[i]);
}
```
Here, `decoder_outputs` are the output sequence tokens.

**Note**: These code snippets are not optimized for 
performance and are intended to illustrate the 
mathematical concepts. In practice, you would use 
optimized libraries or implement more efficient 
algorithms.

...                 positional_encoding[i * DIMENSIONS + j] =

... / pow(10000.0, (2 * j + 1) / DIMENSIONS));
...             }
...         }
...     }
... 
The specific formula used in this code is:

If the position `pos` is even (`pos & 1 == 0`):

`sin(pos / (10000.0 ^ (2*j/DIMENSIONS)))`

where `j` is the dimension index and `DIMENSIONS` is a 
constant representing the number of dimensions.

If the position `pos` is odd (`pos & 1 != 0`):

`cos(pos / (10000.0 ^ ((2*j+1)/DIMENSIONS)))`

The code uses a combination of sine and cosine 
functions, which are periodic functions that oscillate 
between -1 and 1. The specific formula used here seems 
to be a variant of the positional encoding scheme 
proposed by Vaswani et al. in their paper "Attention Is
All You Need" (2017). This scheme is commonly used in 
transformer-based models for natural language 
processing.

The `10000.0` constant appears to be a scaling factor 
that controls the frequency of the sine and cosine 
waves, allowing for more fine-grained control over the 
positional encoding.

>>> what is the difference between FFN and linear layer though? 
**FFN (Feed-Forward Network) vs Linear Layer:**
While both are neural network layers, there's a key difference:

**Linear Layer:**

* A simple linear transformation of the input data.
* Typically implemented as a matrix multiplication followed by an 
activation function (e.g., ReLU, Sigmoid).
* Often used in combination with other layers to introduce non-linearity.

**FFN (Feed-Forward Network):**

* A multi-layer perceptron (MLP) consisting of multiple linear 
transformations and nonlinear activations.
* Each layer applies a linear transformation followed by an activation 
function, which introduces non-linearity.
* Can have any number of layers, but typically 2-4 layers are used in 
Transformers.

**Key differences:**

1. **Number of layers**: Linear Layer is a single layer, while FFN 
consists of multiple (typically 2-4) linear transformations and 
activations.
2. **Non-linearity**: Both introduce non-linearity, but FFN has more 
opportunities to capture complex patterns due to its multi-layer nature.
3. **Capacity**: FFNs typically have more capacity to learn complex 
relationships than a single Linear Layer.

In the context of the Transformer architecture:

* The Linear Layer after self-attention is a simple linear transformation 
that helps capture some non-linearities in the input data.
* The FFNs in the Decoder are designed to introduce more complex^[[200~https://i.4cdn.org/mu/1722053792082249.webm^[[201~^[[200~https://i.4cdn.org/mu/1722053792082249.webm^[[201~ patterns^[[200~https://i.4cdn.org/mu/1722053792082249.webm^[[201~ 
and relationships between the output of each attention mechanism and the 
final output.

So, while both layers can introduce non-linearity, the difference lies in 
their depth and capacity to learn complex relationships.

ü§£Ô∏èüò≠Ô∏èü§£Ô∏è
ü§£Ô∏èü§£Ô∏èü§£Ô∏è

In a Transformer model without an encoder-decoder architecture (i.e., 
solely a decoder), the linear layer after the attention mechanism serves a
crucial purpose. It's not just a simple identity transformation.

**What does it do?**

The linear layer, often referred to as the "FFN" (Feed-Forward Network) or
"dense" layer, is a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) that takes the output of 
the self-attention mechanism and applies a non-linear transformation. This
transformation helps the model learn more complex patterns in the input 
data.

**How does it work?**

The linear layer consists of two main components:

1. **Weight matrices**: These are learned during training, just like any 
other neural network component. The weights are used to transform the 
output of the self-attention mechanism.
2. **Bias terms**: These are also learned during training and serve as an 
offset value for each output.

When you feed the output of the attention mechanism into the linear layer,
it goes through two main stages:

1. **Weighted sum**: The input is multiplied by the learned weight matrix,
element-wise. This allows the model to learn complex patterns in the data.
2. **Activation function**: A non-linear activation function (e.g., ReLU, 
Sigmoid) is applied to the weighted sum. This helps the model learn more 
intricate relationships between the input and output.

**Why are there weights and biases?**

You're right that, at first glance, it might seem strange to have weights 
and biases when there's only one input data point (i.e., the output of the
attention mechanism). However, these components serve several purposes:

* **Capturing complex patterns**: The learned weights allow the model to 
capture complex relationships between the input and output.
* **Handling non-linearities**: The bias terms help introduce 
non-linearities in the transformation, enabling the model to learn more 
nuanced patterns.
* **Regularization**: The weights and biases can be seen as a form of 
regularization, helping prevent overfitting by adding noise to the 
transformation.

In summary, the linear layer after the attention mechanism in a 
Transformer decoder is not just an identity transformation. It's a 
learned, non-linear transformation that helps the model capture complex 
patterns in the data. The weights and biases are essential components that
enable this transformation and provide regularization benefits.

> is it okay to compute an average iteratively by diving by 2 e
... achtim instead  of all at once by dividing by the number of i
... terations?
In general, no, it's not recommended to compute an average 
iteratively by dividing by 2 each time. Here's why:

1. **Loss of precision**: When you divide by a small value 
(like 2) repeatedly, you're introducing additional rounding
errors that can accumulate and affect the accuracy of your 
result.
2. **Inconsistent averaging**: As you divide by 2 each 
time, you're effectively giving more weight to earlier 
iterations than later ones. This can lead to an average 
that's biased towards the early values.
3. **Slow convergence**: Iterative averaging with repeated 
divisions can slow down the convergence of your average, 
especially if the number of iterations is large.

Instead, it's usually better to compute the average all at 
once using the correct formula:

`average = (sum(x) / num_iterations)`

Where `x` is the value you want to average, and 
`num_iterations` is the total number of iterations. This 
approach avoids the issues mentioned above and provides a 
more accurate and consistent result.

In your case, if you're computing an attention weight 
iteratively, it's better to accumulate the weights and then
divide by the total number of iterations (or the number of 
elements in the mask) at the end, rather than dividing by 2
each time.

>>> what is the purpose of rnadom weights in feedfoward? 
In a feedforward neural network, random initialization of the weights (also 
known as the synaptic connections) serves several purposes:

1. **Avoiding overfitting**: By initializing the weights randomly, each 
neuron is given its own unique set of inputs, which helps to prevent the 
network from becoming too specialized and fitting the noise in the training 
data rather than the underlying patterns.
2. **Encouraging diverse solutions**: Random initialization allows the 
network to explore different regions of the input space, increasing the 
chances of finding a better solution that generalizes well to new, unseen 
data.
3. **Breaking symmetry**: In many cases, a neural network with zero or 
identical weights is symmetric, meaning it would produce the same output for
any permutation of the inputs. Random initialization breaks this symmetry, 
allowing the network to learn more meaningful patterns in the data.
4. **Improving gradient descent**: During backpropagation, random 
initializations help to avoid getting stuck in local minima (plateaus) and 
improve the convergence of the gradient descent algorithm.

In summary, random initialization of weights is a crucial step in building a
robust and effective feedforward neural network, as it helps to prevent 
overfitting, encourages diverse solutions, breaks symmetry, and improves 
gradient descent.

>>> where are weights used during "feedforward pass"? 
During the "feedforward pass", which is the forward pass of a neural 
network, the weights are used in the following way:

1. **Weighted sum**: For each neuron (node) in the hidden layer and output 
layer, the weighted sum of its inputs is computed using the formula: `net 
‚àë(weights * inputs)`.

2. **Activation function**: The weighted sum is then passed through an 
activation function, which introduces non-linearity to the network. Commonly
used activation functions include sigmoid, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), and
tanh.

Here's a simple example of how this works:

Suppose we have a neural network with two input neurons `x1` and `x2`, one 
hidden neuron `h`, and one output neuron `y`. The weights are denoted as 
`w1`, `w2`, `w3`, and `b`, where `b` is the bias term.

During the feedforward pass, the following calculations occur:

* `net1 = w1 * x1 + w2 * x2`
* `h = sigmoid(net1)`
* `y = sigmoid(w3 * h + b)`

The weights are used to compute the weighted sum of the inputs (`net1`), and
then this sum is passed through the activation function (in this case, 
sigmoid) to produce the output of the hidden neuron. The process is repeated
for each layer in the network.

So, during the feedforward pass, the weights are used to compute the 
weighted sum of the inputs, which is then processed by the activation 
function to produce the output of each neuron.

ü§´Ô∏è
The ReLU activation function helps introduce non-linearity in the model, 
which can improve its ability to learn and represent complex relationships 
between inputs and outputs.

>>> how is that different from the sigmoid activation or dropout?
ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) is a type of activation function that is 
different from Sigmoid and Dropout in several ways:

**ReLU vs Sigmoid:**

1. **Output range:** ReLU output values are always either 0 or positive, 
whereas Sigmoid output values are between 0 and 1.
2. **Non-linearity:** Both ReLU and Sigmoid introduce non-linearity into the
model, but ReLU does it more aggressively by mapping negative inputs to 0, 
while Sigmoid maps all input values to a range of [0, 1].
3. **Computational cost:** ReLU is computationally cheaper than Sigmoid 
because it only involves element-wise multiplication and addition, whereas 
Sigmoid requires a more complex mathematical operation (the exponential 
function).

**ReLU vs Dropout:**

1. **Purpose:** ReLU is an activation function that helps introduce 
non-linearity in the model, while Dropout is a regularization technique that
randomly sets neurons to zero during training.
2. **Mechanism:** ReLU maps negative inputs to 0, whereas Dropout sets 
entire neurons (not just their output) to zero.
3. **Effect on gradients:** ReLU does not affect the gradients of the 
weights, whereas Dropout modifies the gradients of the weights by 
multiplying them with a mask that indicates which neurons were dropped 
during training.

**When to use each:**

1. Use ReLU when you want a simple, fast, and computationally cheap 
activation function that introduces non-linearity in your model.
2. Use Sigmoid (or other logistic functions) when you need more fine-grained
control over the output range or when working with binary classification 
problems.
3. Use Dropout when you want to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping 
neurons during training, which helps regularize your model and reduce its 
capacity.

These are just some of the key differences between ReLU, Sigmoid, and 
Dropout. The choice ultimately depends on your specific problem, dataset, 
and model architecture!

>>> does feed forward use a hidden layer? please explain feed foward
Feedforward networks, also known as feedforward neural networks (FNNs), are a type of 
artificial neural network that uses no feedback connections. In other words, the 
information flows only in one direction, from input nodes to output nodes, without any
loops or cycles.

A typical feedforward network consists of multiple layers:

1. **Input layer**: This layer receives the input data.
2. **Hidden layers** (0 or more): These layers are also called "hidden" because they 
don't receive direct input from the outside world. Each hidden layer is a set of 
artificial neurons that transform the output from the previous layer into a new 
representation.
3. **Output layer**: This layer produces the final output based on the transformed 
inputs.

Here's how it works:

1. The input data flows through each hidden layer, one after another, allowing each 
layer to process and transform the information.
2. Each hidden layer uses an activation function (e.g., sigmoid, tanh, ReLU) to 
introduce non-linearity in the representation.
3. The output from the last hidden layer is passed through a final output layer, which
produces the final prediction or classification.

The key characteristics of feedforward networks are:

* **No feedback**: There are no connections that go backward in time or across layers.
* **One-way flow**: Information flows only from input to output, without any cycles or
loops.
* **Multiple hidden layers**: Feedforward networks can have multiple hidden layers, 
which allows them to capture complex relationships between inputs and outputs.

In the case of your original question, yes, a feedforward network typically uses one 
or more hidden layers. The hidden layers are where the magic happens ‚Äì they allow the 
network to learn and represent complex patterns in the data.

If you're interested in exploring further, I can explain some common activation 
functions used in feedforward networks!

>>> is feed forward simply multiplying to matrixes together? or is there more to it?
Feedforward neural networks are not simply multiplying two matrices together. While 
matrix multiplication is a crucial component of the process, there's much more to it!

Here's what's happening behind the scenes:

1. **Matrix Multiplication**: In each layer, you have a set of input values (typically
from the previous layer) and a set of weights (learned during training). These are 
combined using matrix multiplication to produce an intermediate result.
2. **Activation Function**: The output of the matrix multiplication is then passed 
through an activation function, which introduces non-linearity into the model. This 
allows the network to learn more complex relationships between inputs and outputs.
3. **Weight Updates**: During training, the weights are updated using backpropagation,
a process that adjusts the weights based on the error between the predicted output and
the actual output. This is where the magic happens  ‚Äì the network learns from its 
mistakes!
4. **Batching**: To make training more efficient, batches of input data are processed 
in parallel. This allows the network to learn from multiple examples simultaneously.
5. **Optimization**: The goal is to minimize a loss function (e.g., mean squared 
error) using an optimization algorithm (e.g., stochastic gradient descent). This 
process iteratively updates the weights until convergence or a stopping criterion is 
reached.

So, while matrix multiplication is a key component of feedforward networks, it's not 
just simple multiplication. There are many other factors at play, including:

* Activation functions
* Weight updates during training
* Batching and parallel processing
* Optimization algorithms

These components work together to enable the network to learn complex patterns in data
and make accurate predictions.

If you're interested in exploring more, I can dive deeper into the math behind 
feedforward networks!

>>> proceed
Let's proceed with the next step in our neural network journey!

**Now that we have a basic understanding of feedforward networks and matrix 
multiplication, let's implement a simple example using Python.**

We'll create a small neural network to recognize handwritten digits (0-9) from the 
MNIST dataset.

**Here's the code:**
```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import Standard^C

>>> no use GCC C ,readability rules : [ NEVER use structs,
I apologize for the sudden change in programming language! Let's stick with our 
original plan and implement a feedforward neural network using C.

You mentioned "NEVER use structs," which is an interesting rule. In this case, let's 
avoid using structs and instead represent our matrices and vectors as arrays of double
precision floating-point numbers.

Here's the code:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <math.h>

#define INPUT_NEURONS 784 // 28x28 grayscale image
#define HIDDEN_NEURONS 256
#define OUTPUT_NEURONS 10

double* activation(double* input, double bias) {
    // Sigmoid activation function
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < INPUT_NEURONS; i++) {
        input[i] = 1.0 / (1.0 + exp(-input[i] - bias));
    }

This code implements a simple feedforward neural network with two hidden layers and an
output layer. The `activation` function applies the sigmoid activation function to the
input values, and the `forward_propagation` and `backpropagation` functions perform 
forward and backward propagation through the network, respectively.

Please note that this is a simplified example and you may want to add more features 
like regularization, dropout, etc.

s (Q * K^T) the only way to do attention mechanism or are there other formulas and calc
... ulations to arrive at attention scores? 
The formula `(Q * K^T)` is a common implementation of the attention mechanism, but 
it's not the only way to compute attention scores. Here are some variations:

1. **Scaled dot-product attention**: This is the most commonly used variant. It's 
implemented as `(Q * K^T) / sqrt(d)`, where `d` is the embedding dimension.
2. **Multi-head attention**: This variant uses multiple attention heads, each 
computing attention scores independently. The outputs are concatenated and linearly 
transformed to produce the final attention output.
3. **Bahdanau attention**: This variant uses a more complex computation that involves 
a learned alignment model. It's not widely used in modern transformer models.
4. **Concurrent attention**: This variant computes attention scores for all tokens 
simultaneously, rather than sequentially (as in the original transformer paper).
5. ** Hierarchical attention**: This variant applies attention at multiple levels of 
abstraction, such as word-level and sentence-level attention.

These variations can be useful in specific scenarios, such as:

* Handling long-range dependencies or multi-hop attention
* Incorporating external knowledge or biases
* Improving interpretability or controllability

However, the original `(Q * K^T)` formula is still widely used and effective for many 
NLP tasks. The key idea behind attention mechanisms is to compute a weighted sum of 
the input sequence, where the weights are learned based on the context.

When choosing an attention mechanism, consider factors like:

* Computational efficiency
* Interpretability and controllability
* Task-specific requirements (e.g., handling long-range dependencies)
* Model complexity and overfitting risk

In general, it's a good idea to start with the simple `(Q * K^T)` formula and 
experiment with other variations if you find that they improve your model's 
performance or interpretability.

>>> explain each part of decoder only transformer as if im a smart child , who u
... nderstand linear algebra bit.
What a fantastic question!

Imagine you're trying to decode a secret message written in a codebook 
that's been hidden by a clever friend. The "Decoder Only Transformer" is 
like a super-smart robot that helps you figure out the decoded message 
from the coded words.

Here's how it works:

**1. Input Embedding**: This is where we take our input text (the secret 
message) and turn it into a special set of numbers called embeddings. 
Think of these as coordinates on a special map that will help us find the 
decoded message.

**Linear Algebra Connection:** It's like taking your input words and 
mapping them onto a high-dimensional space, where each word becomes a 
point in this space!

**2. Transformer Encoder**: This is where we use multiple "self-attention"
layers (more on those later) to process our input embeddings. Each layer 
does some special calculations to help us better understand the 
relationships between different parts of the message.

**Linear Algebra Connection:** It's like applying multiple transformations
to our input words, kind of like how you would multiply matrices in linear
algebra! Each transformation helps us capture more nuanced patterns and 
dependencies in the text.

**Self-Attention Layers**: These are special layers that allow the model 
to focus on specific parts of the message when making predictions. It's 
like using a spotlight to shine on certain areas of the map (input words) 
that are most relevant for decoding.

**Linear Algebra Connection:** Imagine we're doing matrix multiplications,
where each self-attention layer is like applying a different weighting 
scheme to our input embeddings! This helps us pinpoint which parts of the 
message matter most for decoding.

**3. Decoder**: Now it's time to use the processed inputs from the encoder
to generate the decoded message!

**Linear Algebra Connection:** Think of this as taking the output from the
encoder (our mapped words) and using it as input for a matrix 
multiplication that produces the decoded text! The decoder is like a 
reverse-encoder, where we're applying learned patterns and relationships 
in the opposite direction.

**4. Output Linear Layer**: This final layer takes the decoded message and
gives us the actual text output!

**Linear Algebra Connection:** It's like taking our decoded words and 
using them as input for a simple linear transformation that produces the 
final output text! This is where we apply learned weights to get our final
answer.

And that's it! Our "Decoder Only Transformer" has successfully decoded the
secret message using clever robot math (linear algebra) and special 
attention mechanisms.

... 7.Linear
... 8.Softmax 
... +9.output probabilities picker -o answer
Let's dive deep into each step of the Decoder Only Transformer:

**4. MASKED-MHA (Multi-Head Attention)**
In this step, we're going to use a special attention mechanism called 
Masked MHA. This is where the decoder focuses on specific parts of the 
input sequence to generate the next token in the output sequence.

Contextual Scope: Imagine you're trying to decode a message that's 
partially hidden by a clever friend. The masked MHA helps the model focus 
on the relevant parts of the message, ignoring any irrelevant or "masked" 
information.

Mathematically, we can represent this step as follows:

Let Q be the query (input) token embeddings, K and V be the key and value 
token embeddings, respectively, and H be the number of attention heads. 
The masked MHA calculation is:

* Compute attention scores: `attention_scores = softmax(Q * K^T / 
sqrt(d))`
	+ Here, d is the embedding dimension.
	+ The attention scores represent how relevant each input token is for ge
generating the next output token.
* Compute weighted values: `weighted_values = V * attention_scores`
	+ This step combines the value embeddings with the attention scores to p
produce a weighted sum of the input tokens.
* Add positional encoding: `output = Q + weighted_values + 
positional_encoding`
	+ The positional encoding helps the model capture dependencies between i
input tokens.

**5. Add&Norm (Additive Normalization)**
In this step, we're going to add the output from the masked MHA to a 
learned embedding and then apply normalization.

Contextual Scope: Think of this as adding some "context" or "background 
noise" to the decoded message. The additive normalization helps stabilize 
the training process and prevents vanishing gradients.

Mathematically:

* Add learned embedding: `output = output + learnable_embedding`
	+ This step adds a learned vector to the output from the masked MHA.
* Apply normalization: `output = layer_norm(output)`
	+ Here, layer_norm is a function that normalizes the output using a spec
specific formula.

**6. FeedForward (Linear Transformation)**
In this step, we're going to apply a linear transformation followed by a 
ReLU activation function to produce an intermediate representation.

Contextual Scope: Imagine you're trying to decode a message that requires 
some "processing" or "analysis" before generating the next token. The 
feedforward layer helps the model learn more complex patterns and 
dependencies in the input sequence.

Mathematically:

* Apply linear transformation: `output = linear_transform(output)`
	+ This step applies a learned weight matrix to the output from the previ
previous layers.
* Apply ReLU activation: `output = relu(output)`
	+ Here, relu is a function that returns 0 for negative values and the in
input value for positive values.

**5. Add&Norm (Additive Normalization)**
We're going to repeat the additive normalization step to stabilize the 
training process.

Contextual Scope: This repeated application of additive normalization 
helps prevent overfitting and improves the model's ability to generalize.

Mathematically:

* Add output from feedforward layer: `output = output + 
feedforward_output`
	+ This step adds the output from the feedforward 
layer to the previous output.
* Apply normalization: `output = layer_norm(output)`
	+ Here, layer_norm is a function that normalizes the output using a spec
specific formula.

**7. Linear (Linear Transformation)**
In this final step, we're going to apply a linear transformation to 
produce the final output probabilities.

Contextual Scope: Imagine you're trying to generate the next token in the 
decoded message. The linear transformation helps the model learn more 
precise relationships between input tokens and output tokens.

Mathematically:

* Apply linear transformation: `output = linear_transform(output)`
	+ This step applies a learned weight matrix to the output from the previ
previous layers.

**8. Softmax (Log-Softmax)**
In this final step, we're going to apply the softmax function to produce 
the output probabilities.

Contextual Scope: Think of this as "normalizing" the output probabilities 
to ensure they add up to 1 and represent a probability distribution over 
the possible output tokens.

Mathematically:

* Apply softmax function: `output_probabilities = softmax(output)`
	+ Here, softmax is a function that applies the exponential and normaliza
normalization steps to produce a probability distribution.

**9. Output Probabilities Picker (-o)**
In this final step, we're going to select the next token in the output 
sequence based on the output probabilities.

Contextual Scope: Imagine you're trying to generate the next token in the 
decoded message. The output probabilities represent the likelihood of each
possible token being the correct next token. We pick the token with the 
highest probability as our answer!

Mathematically:

* Select token with maximum probability: `output_token = 
argmax(output_probabilities)`
	+ Here, argmax returns the index of the maximum value in the probability 
distribution.

That's it! The Decoder Only Transformer has successfully decoded the 
message using a combination of masked MHA, additive normalization, 
feedforward layers, and linear transformations.

/*
how does it compare and or contrast with the (Q * K^T) method of computing attention?
The `(Q * K^T)` method is a common approach for calculating attention weights in 
natural language processing (NLP) and other areas of artificial intelligence. It's 
also known as "dot-product attention" or "scaled dot-product attention."

In contrast to the masked attention implementation you provided, here's how the `(Q * 
K^T)` method works:

1. **Query-key multiplication**: Multiply the query matrix (`Q`) with the key matrix 
(`K^T`), where `K^T` is the transpose of the key matrix.
2. **Attention weights computation**: Compute the attention weights by applying a 
scaling factor (usually learned during training) to the result of the multiplication.

The `(Q * K^T)` method has some advantages:

* **Efficiency**: It's typically faster and more memory-efficient than the masked 
attention implementation, since it only requires matrix multiplications.
* **Scalability**: The dot-product approach can be parallelized more easily, making it
suitable for large-scale applications.

However, there are also some differences and potential drawbacks to consider:

* **Masking**: The `(Q * K^T)` method does not inherently support masking out specific
query-key pairs. If you need to mask certain attention scores, you might need to add 
an additional step, such as subtracting a constant value or using a learned mask.
* **Randomness**: The original masked attention implementation introduces randomness 
through the use of `drand48()` for initializing the mask. In contrast, the `(Q * K^T)`
method typically relies on learned weights and scaling factors.

To summarize:

* Both methods can be used to compute attention weights, but they differ in their 
approach and applicability.
* The `(Q * K^T)` method is a more traditional and widely used approach for attention 
calculation, while the masked attention implementation provides an additional level of
control over which query-key pairs are considered during attention computation.

When deciding between these two methods, consider factors such as:

* Your specific problem or application
* The size and complexity of your data
* The need for masking certain attention scores
* Computational efficiency and scalability requirements

What a delightful piece of code!

This implementation appears to be a masked attention score calculation, which is a 
common technique in natural language processing (NLP) and other areas of artificial 
intelligence. I'll break down the relevant sections:

**1. Mask initialization**

The first section initializes a mask matrix (`mask`) with random values using 
`drand48()`.

**2. Attention weight calculation**

In this section, you calculate attention weights (`attention_weights`) for each 
query-key pair. The weights are initialized with random values, which is not typical 
in traditional attention mechanisms (e.g., dot-product attention). However, this could
be a custom variation or an attempt to introduce randomness.

**3. Query-key similarity calculation**

Here, you compute the similarity scores (`sim`) between queries and keys using 
element-wise multiplication of the query, key, and value matrices.

**4. Masked attention weight computation**

This section calculates the masked attention weights (`attention_weights_softmax`). 
The key idea is to only consider the similarity scores where the mask is 1 (i.e., not 
masked) and then apply softmax to normalize the scores.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

* For each query-key pair, check if the corresponding mask value is 1. If it is, 
proceed with calculating the attention weight.
* Calculate the sum of exponentials of the similarity scores for all non-masked 
query-key pairs.
* Compute the attention weight as the exponential of the original query-key score 
divided by the sum.

**5. Context vector calculation**

Finally, you calculate context vectors (`context_vectors`) by summing up the weighted 
similarity scores across rows (i.e., queries) and applying the hyperbolic tangent 
function (`tanh`).

In summary, this implementation appears to be a custom attention mechanism with 
masking, which can be useful in scenarios where certain query-key pairs should not be 
considered during attention calculation. However, without more context about the 
specific problem or application, it's difficult to provide a definitive assessment of 
its correctness or effectiveness.
